Findr (Fast Inference of Networks from Directed Regulations) is a statistical
inference tool for genetics. It predicts the probability of pairwise gene
regulation probability based on gene expression level data. When genotype data
is available for the best eQTLs, higher prediction accuracy can be achieved.
The pairwise regulation probability is then applied for the reconstruction of
gene regulation networks.

Findr obtains much higher accuracy and faster speed than existing programs [1].
This is due to the analytical and implementational advances. Findr library can
be downloaded from [2].

This package is the python interface of Findr library, downloadable from [3]. It
requires Findr library to be pre-installed. Due to incompatibility issues of
Cygwin with non-Cygwin programs, the python interface does not support Windows.
The binary interface and R package are also provided for Findr, downloadable
from [4] and [5] respectively. The binary interface supports Windows.

A more detailed documentation of Findr can be found as doc.pdf.
