For detailed updates in findr library functionality, see UPDATES in findr library.

1.0.6:
	Corrected a bug that may produce biased output in pij_gassist, pij_gassist_trad, and pijs_gassist when nodiag is set or when memlimit is small so computation is split into chunks.
	Now setting histogram bounds based on the maximum of all LLRs (as opposed to the maximum of the chunk when memlimit is small) in pij_gassist, pij_gassist_trad, and pijs_gassist. This ensures the output is independent of memlimit (related to question from sritchie73@github).
	Added sanity checks for agreement between input data and nodiag flag for pij functions excluding _pv (suggested by sritchie73@github).
1.0.4:
	Adapted for python2/3.
1.0.3:
	Updated examples (reported by mdbahadur@github).
	Bug corrections in raising errors.
1.0.2:
	Bug corrections in examples.		
1.0.0:
	New functions:
		Included P-value computation for 4 tests in pijs_gassist_pv and correlation test in pij_rank_pv.
		Included using continuous anchors (instead of discrete genotypes) for causal inference in pij(s)_cassist*.
	Revisions:
		Now allows to load libraries with a different patch version (but the major & minor versions must still remain the same with those of the interface).
		Now also tries automatically to load Findr's shared library from ~/.local/lib.
0.5.0:
	New function: reconstruction of directed acyclic graph from prior information of edge significance in method netr_one_greedy. For details, see doc.pdf.
0.4.1:
	Minor updates on documentation.
	Updated copyright.
